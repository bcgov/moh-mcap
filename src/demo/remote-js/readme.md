The files in this folder are NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THIS PROJECT.  They are remote JS files, hosted on the CafeX media broker. It is likely we can change them if necessary - speak to Dustin(?).

The main important file is `assist.js`, which is pretty interwoven with `assist-support.js` and `short-code-assist.js` (which are both part of this project).  Other files are often loaded through `assist-controller.html`

The sole purpose of these files is to help with debugging/understanding the project.
