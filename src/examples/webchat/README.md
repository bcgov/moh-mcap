# Webchat example code

### index.html

This is a basic single file example for how to open a webchat session
You can run this from any http server or even as a local file. It requires no Javascript for its basic operation although you may decide to add your own scripting for enhanced features.
A webchat session must be started with an http POST request as shown in the code.  It is possible to wrap a POST in a GET as shown in the autopost example below.

To use:
1. Edit the "action" attribute of the form element if needed.
2. Open index.html with your browser.
3. Click the "Start Webchat" button
